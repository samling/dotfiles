May 03 13:54:35 <Nivim>	There are clearly ways to downgrade packages, but how does one downgrade the master package database? (From what I can gather, I need to upgrade in controlled steps, but foolishly used the latest package databases, making any upgrades impossible.)
May 03 13:54:51 <MrElendig>	why do you want to do this?

May 03 13:55:05 <MrElendig>	what is the actual problem?
May 03 13:55:17 <Nivim>	Brining an extremely out of date system to current.

May 03 13:56:03 <Nivim>	Is there a good way to back stuff up without mounting anything?
May 03 13:56:04 <MrElendig>	15min vs steve ballmer knows how many houers and litres of booze
May 03 13:56:10 <MrElendig>	dd
May 03 13:56:22 <MrElendig>	(or any other block level backup solution=
May 03 13:56:27 <Nivim>	Thank you.
May 03 13:56:29 <MrElendig>	why not mount though?
May 03 13:56:37 <Nivim>	Because that doesn't work until I can upgrade again.
May 03 13:56:54 <MrElendig>	uhm what
May 03 13:56:59 <MrElendig>	is the filesystem broken?
May 03 13:57:21 <Nivim>	Currently a lot of functions on this system are broken for reason I don't entirely understand, but when I look up solutions, the answer is usually -Syu.
May 03 13:57:27 *	heywoodlh has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.4)
May 03 13:57:39 <MrElendig>	just how out of date is this system
May 03 13:57:48 <Nivim>	About 2-3 years.
May 03 13:58:29 *	mSSM has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
May 03 13:58:38 <Scimmia>	did the upgrade fail? at 2 years, you may be fine
May 03 13:59:18 <Nivim>	The upgrade has failed in many, many different ways. I've run the commands for pacman -Su dozens of times now in various incarnations, each time getting through more errors.

May 03 13:59:40 <MrElendig>	you can keep your /home
May 03 13:59:43 <Nivim>	(Really though, now that my attention has been directed to a non-mount way of backup stuff up, I can just-- yes.)
