May 03 13:48:15 <paulguy>	if it's completely disabled, a watchdog I guess reboots the board.
May 03 13:48:35 <paulguy>	every few minutes or something
May 03 13:48:43 <SysGhost>	indeed. I've read about attempts to erase it completely, it jsut won't post 
May 03 13:48:47 <HEX0>	30 minutes
May 03 13:49:08 <HEX0>	according to github page after 30 minutes system shuts down
May 03 13:49:30 <HEX0>	if ME or signing key is not present or something
May 03 13:50:18 <HEX0>	and it runs minix, so the year of minux desktop afaik.
May 03 13:50:33 <soft_cement>	Depending on what you
May 03 13:50:48 <HEX0>	so I guess the year of Minix desktop happened long ago lol
May 03 13:51:05 <soft_cement>	You're after, putting a firewall between the machine and your gateway could be a way of stopping it from calling home... maybe? Just a guess
May 03 13:52:54 *	SysGhost ssh's into the PSP, and executes "echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/self_destruct".
May 03 13:53:03 <HEX0>	bittersweet that we can't have libre x86 hardware while linux FOSS drivers got so good
May 03 13:53:22 <soft_cement>	I would like to see RISC-V become an option
May 03 13:53:53 <soft_cement>	this exists: https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1
May 03 13:53:57 <phrik>	Title: HiFive1 - SiFive (at www.sifive.com)
May 03 13:54:08 <soft_cement>	IIRC, it's a fully Libre RISC-V dev board
May 03 13:54:23 <HEX0>	I wonder if it would be possible to emulate legacy x86 prorpietary games on Talos Power9 systems with acceptable performance 
May 03 13:54:56 <soft_cement>	you want libre hardware to play proprietary video games? really?
May 03 13:55:27 <HEX0>	would be nice thought wouldn't it
May 03 13:55:33 <paulguy>	i'm OK with application software being proprietary to some degree, I at least accept it.
May 03 13:55:48 <paulguy>	but the basis of a system it would be nice to be totally out there.
May 03 13:55:54 <soft_cement>	paulguy: agreed
May 03 13:56:27 <soft_cement>	hardware, firmware, kernel... so the user has freedom and can know what their system is up to, if they wish
May 03 13:56:48 <soft_cement>	if they wish to install proprietary software/spyware on top of that, then that's their choice, they're not forced into it
May 03 13:58:01 <paulguy>	would be nice if that stuff wasn't a thing either heh
May 03 13:59:20 <SysGhost>	HEX0: Somne more info about it: https://www.howtogeek.com/334013/intel-management-engine-explained-the-tiny-computer-inside-your-cpu/ And two quotes I'd like to snip out: 
May 03 13:59:22 <SysGhost>	-"This isn’t any sort of spying or monitoring software—unless an organization has enabled AMT and is using it to monitor their own PCs. If Intel’s Management Engine was contacting the network in other situations, we’d likely have heard of it thanks to tools like Wireshark, which allow people to monitor traffic on a network."
May 03 13:59:31 <SysGhost>	-"However, the presence of software like Intel ME that can’t be disabled and is closed source is certainly a security concern. It’s another avenue for attack, and we’ve already seen security holes in Intel ME."
May 03 14:00:52 <dmc>	how bad of an idea would it be to get drunk prior to going to watch a 3 hour long movie
May 03 14:01:08 <SysGhost>	Same goes for AMD. One wonder what the american congress forces large american-owned multinational companies to do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
May 03 14:01:13 <haavard>	dmc: amazing idea honestly 
May 03 14:01:19 <dmc>	> A urologist’s tips on watching the 3-hour-plus ‘Avengers: Endgame’ without a bathroom break
May 03 14:01:20 <paulguy>	probably end up having to pee a few times
May 03 14:01:23 <dmc>	lol haavard
May 03 14:01:25 <haavard>	Movie is too boring sober 
May 03 14:01:46 <haavard>	If you have a festival bladder it's all good 
May 03 14:01:49 <SysGhost>	haavard: you're watching the wrong movies then
May 03 14:01:53 <dmc>	going to need to note good times for bathroom breaks if I do this
May 03 14:01:57 <dmc>	I do not
May 03 14:01:59 <HEX0>	dmc: you'll probably forget the plot mid movie
May 03 14:02:01 <haavard>	SysGhost: indeed 
May 03 14:02:08 <dmc>	and I'd be getting drunk on beer
May 03 14:02:16 <dmc>	HEX0, perhaps..
May 03 14:02:27 <haavard>	dmc: dehydrate yourself prior to drinking beer 
May 03 14:02:50 <HEX0>	dmc: don't recommend watching a horror movie after smoking a joint though. pretty intense in that state :P
May 03 14:03:06 *	F55 (~umryk@unaffiliated/fer755) has joined
May 03 14:03:11 <SysGhost>	Trick is: empty your baldder just before entering the cinema. Even if you don't need to. Squeeze the drops out so the bladder is all empty. that'll make you last for a good 2-5 hours depending on liquid intake and bladder-zize. 
May 03 14:03:47 <paulguy>	expanded bladder implants
May 03 14:03:53 <dmc>	I'd be drinking up to 75 oz of beer
May 03 14:04:00 <dmc>	any more and I might not make it to the theater
May 03 14:04:20 <SysGhost>	Talking of which... time for me to go grab a bunch of bottles ... BBL...
May 03 14:04:28 <haavard>	How much is 75 oz 
May 03 14:04:29 <F55>	theatr balder zizzer respawner
May 03 14:04:40 <dmc>	in what
May 03 14:04:59 <haavard>	Normal units 
May 03 14:04:59 <paulguy>	!convert 75 floz l
May 03 14:05:00 <phrik>	paulguy: 2.22
May 03 14:05:06 <HEX0>	or just put a catheter in there and enjoy you beer
May 03 14:05:07 <F55>	popcorn balder
May 03 14:05:16 <haavard>	What so like four pints 
May 03 14:05:18 <haavard>	Come on 
May 03 14:05:26 <haavard>	I thought you said drunk 
May 03 14:05:47 <SysGhost>	uh... one more thing.... one can bring an empty emergenzy-bottle, and do the business during the most intense scenes when everyone is so occupied they'd never notice it. Loud scenes works the best =P
May 03 14:06:14 <paulguy>	you can buy those hospital pee jugs
May 03 14:06:31 <HEX0>	make sure to loudly drink something through a straw while peeing in the bottle
May 03 14:06:52 <SysGhost>	in that case... don't mix the bottles.
May 03 14:07:05 <F55>	in the middle of the movie they starting to moving the air, so start entering cold breeze, too damn cold
May 03 14:07:06 <haavard>	Just man up and hold it 
May 03 14:07:20 <HEX0>	that might be a challenge when you are drunk. could easily mix up bottles
May 03 14:07:28 <haavard>	Or man up and realize you can miss a scene 
May 03 14:07:48 <SysGhost>	Noes!
May 03 14:07:50 <Reventlov>	is it bad if I recognize domino's pizza in people fart
May 03 14:08:06 <HEX0>	no you are gifted
May 03 14:08:07 <SysGhost>	Yep
May 03 14:08:14 <SysGhost>	...but gifted...

May 03 14:09:43 <haavard>	True 
May 03 14:10:14 <haavard>	The budget drinker will fast for a day and then get smashed on a single pint 
May 03 14:10:17 <SysGhost>	Reventlov: you really need to write more insanity.
May 03 14:10:21 <haavard>	NextHendrix does that because he's poor 
May 03 14:10:21 <dmc>	I don't fast
May 03 14:10:26 <dmc>	but I don't do a pre-game meal
May 03 14:10:38 <dmc>	though I do have a fat meal after 25 or 50 oz
May 03 14:10:56 <NextHendrix>	haavard is right
May 03 14:11:54 <SysGhost>	Am I the only one who aims to drink a lot and avoid getting smashed?

May 03 14:18:17 <SysGhost>	Heard that one, when a tad older and can't take as much alcohol, can get around it by lowering the sugar intake for a few hours/days before a "drink out" to get more headroom before the roof is hit. Haven't tested it though.

May 03 14:20:52 <phrik>	dmc: Urban Dictionary: smashed <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=smashed>
May 03 14:21:04 <dmc>	oh
May 03 14:21:04 <MrElendig>	not being able to drink a litre of 96% in 30 mins is generally not a bad thing
May 03 14:21:05 <fckr>	if you smash the bottles on the floor before you get smashed, you won't get poisoned
May 03 14:21:36 <dmc>	I take back what I said
May 03 14:21:45 <dmc>	s/smashed/alcohol poisoning/
May 03 14:21:58 <dmc>	to get smashed is my goal
May 03 14:22:28 <fckr>	sober -> tipsy -> drunk -> smashed -> poisoned -> ded
May 03 14:22:29 <SysGhost>	dmc: How fast one get drunk, and how much it takes before getting drunk is different. You're right that if on emty stomach, the alcoholl gets into the system faster, but the factor of how much it takes before one get to a certain level still differes on what's already in the system.
May 03 14:22:31 <paulguy>	haven't drank enough to throw up in a while.
May 03 14:22:55 <dmc>	wut
May 03 14:24:12 <F55>	gin
May 03 14:24:16 <HEX0>	paulguy: oh yeah it's probably the most miserable feeling after food poisoning
May 03 14:24:33 <NextHendrix>	i don't always throw up, but when i do it's during predrinks
May 03 14:24:38 <F55>	more empty stomach is a bad thing
May 03 14:24:39 <NextHendrix>	then go out refreshes
