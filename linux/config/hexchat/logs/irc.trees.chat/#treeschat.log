Apr 30 13:57:22 <HoodieWearellson>	 alright monotoke basically the meta to Tetris is that even though the pieces are random, they are only random to a certain degree and they still go through a cycle
Apr 30 13:57:45 <monotoke>	 mm
Apr 30 13:58:10 <HoodieWearellson>	 there's a lot to it, but eventually the trick is learning how to chain perfect clears
Apr 30 13:58:15 <HoodieWearellson>	 and set up t-spins
Apr 30 13:58:37 <HoodieWearellson>	 then there are a few different strats for when you start to get rushed and how to sort things
Apr 30 13:58:58 <monotoke>	 wtf is tspin
Apr 30 13:59:16 <monotoke>	 the tile cycle ?
Apr 30 13:59:34 <rofldongs>	monotoke:  fitting the Ts into spots they shouldnt go

May 01 22:58:34 <keck>	Gotcha. I had like 64 in my mind
May 01 22:58:36 <Sardistic>	the sever owner is working on another server thats 64 atm, but could go higher

May 01 22:59:31 <Sardistic>	sync issues
May 01 22:59:55 <Sardistic>	i think the main problem atm is theres a player that has such a good ping to the server he keeps acting as the host instead, and desyncs people he interacts with

May 06 10:22:20 <goldy>	don't they have a new version of the 3 coming out?
May 06 10:22:35 <tentacruel>	 that could be why they're dropping the price rn

May 06 10:22:58 <Sheepy>	 they're a little better of a deal
May 06 10:23:03 <Sheepy>	 I went from virgin mobile to google fi
May 06 10:23:08 <goldy>	i like how their data works
May 06 10:23:15 <tentacruel>	 how does it work?
May 06 10:23:21 <tentacruel>	 i realized i don't really use much date
May 06 10:23:23 <tentacruel>	 data
May 06 10:23:24 <Sheepy>	 Same I've only used .7 gb of data so far
May 06 10:23:27 <goldy>	stops at $60 for unlimited
May 06 10:23:30 <tentacruel>	 when i was traveling, i used quite a bit
May 06 10:23:35 <tentacruel>	 dang that's already cheaper than tmobile
May 06 10:23:38 <Sheepy>	 yeah it's easier to use data when traveling
May 06 10:23:59 <goldy>	but you pay for what you use
May 06 10:24:00 <Sheepy>	 Virgin mobile was 35/mo + tax for 300 min, unlimited data *(throttled after a certain amount)
May 06 10:24:02 <Sheepy>	 ^
May 06 10:24:10 <goldy>	so if it's like 1 gig of data you pay like $10
May 06 10:24:12 <Sheepy>	 And it shows you too how much data you're using
